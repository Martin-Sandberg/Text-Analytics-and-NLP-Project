# Text-Analytics-and-NLP-Project

Group project for Text Analytics and Natural Language Processing (NLP) course. The goal is to use Text Analytics to predict a business outcome based on survey responders answers to previous questions. 

Our team designed a survey, collected audio responses, transformed audio to text data, analyzed text data in R (Token Frequency, Sentiment Analysis, n-grams, TF-IDF, Naive Bayes), and designed a Shiny application to present business insights.
